Hi, I'm Leerang! I am a machine learning scientist interested in the intersection of biology, engineering, and machine learning. 

Currently I am an AI Research Scientist working on developing generative models for molecular design at [1910 Genetics](https://1910genetics.com/). Previously, I worked as a data scientist developing next-generation vaccines at [Apriori Bio](https://aprioribio.com/), where I worked on prediction of viral evolution, epitope-paratope prediction, high-throughput library design, and protein sequence design. Prior to that, I was an [AI fellow at Flagship Pioneering](https://www.flagshippioneering.com/join/fellows#chapter-6) in summer of 2023, where I worked on venture creation ideas related to AI.

I received my PhD from MIT in October 2023, advised by [Prof. Arup Chakraborty](https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/arup-k-chakraborty/). At MIT, I developed computational models of the immune system's response to vaccination, with the goal of developing [more effective vaccination strategies](https://news.mit.edu/2024/two-dose-schedule-could-make-hiv-vaccines-more-effective-0920). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Columbia University, where I worked on [developing novel catalysts for key reactions in fuel cell technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378775315005704). 

I am very interested in how AI is enabling us to engineer molecules, to understand and manipulate how they interact with biological systems, and to uncover novel targets. These advancements will not only accelerate the drug discovery process, but fundamentally change what is possible. I am trying to learn as much as I can, and I will be sharing some thoughts in my blog. 

Outside of work, you might find me swimming at MIT's Alumni Pool, walking around the neighborhood in Somerville, or hiking and camping the White Mountains!
